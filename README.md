To convert DICOM files to video for deep feature extraction, you can use file [./Exterate_Deep_Features/ACRINTovideo.py](https://github.com/FORRESTHUACHEN/Siamese_Neural_Network_based_Brest_cancer_Radiogenomic/blob/ConverMRIDICOMtoVideo/Exterate_Deep_Features/ACRINTovideo.py) to finish this transfer. An example of finished videos file for patient'ISPY2-100899_phase_2' can be found in directory './Exterate_Deep_Features'
